# eVSIF-MB
 Someone and I were planning to collaborate on the production of eVSIF, which was positioned as an upgraded version of VSIF and supported 15 expansion card slots. It could play VGM and play MIDI music with MamidiMEMO. However, due to some nonsensical reasons, the cooperation was unilaterally terminated by someone. So I uploaded eVSIF to commemorate our previous cooperation.
